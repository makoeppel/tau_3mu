Introduction
====

This is code for the poster [Adaptive Machine Learning on FPGAs: Bridging Simulated and Real-World Data in High-Energy Physics](https://indico.nikhef.nl/event/4875/contributions/20369/) presented at the EuCAIFCon24 conference,

Data
====
To run the code one needs to download the data from the [Flavours of Physics: Finding τ → μμμ](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/flavours-of-physics) competition.

Code
====
The main code is explained in more detail in `main.ipynb` for the VHDL simulation to implement the bernoulli layer one finds an example testbanch in the `tb` folder.
